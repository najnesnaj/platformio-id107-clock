there are 2 methods to upload to the smartwatch : 

1) classic : connect uploaddevice (in my case stmlink-v2 to the watch)
2) upload via bluetooth (FOTA firmware over the air, DFU device firmware update)




1) classic upload 
here you have to combine s130_nrf51_2.0.1_softdevice.hex with the compiled program, with a utily called mergehex (since I use unix, I use the python version of mergehex)

to upload : ./upload (uses openocd and stmlink v2)

2) upload via bluetooth
this method uses the secure upload method, so you need the priv_key.pem and the booter.hex (which contains the bootloader that makes swithing to DFU possible)
for a detailed description : https://github.com/najnesnaj/ota-dfu-smartband 

here the watch has to be in DFU mode

There are two methods to get it into DFU mode
A) if you upload the booter.hex, by default it will be in DFU mode (use the uploadboater script)
B) from within a program you can softreset the watch, which will put it into DFU mode

once the watch is in DFU mode
to upload ./uploadblue (adapt bluetooth mac address)




NOTE:

the script : upload-test,  contains a script that uploads softdevice + bootloader + application (and starts the application) -- so here you avoid uploading booter.hex (DFU capable) and uploading via bluetooth -- so this is the preferred method, because you always have the option to use DFU OTA

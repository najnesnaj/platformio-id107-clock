# platformio-id107
nrf51822 ID107 smartwatch arduino clock 

this is work in progress, that piggy backs on previous work by many people, mainly : @goran-mahovlic, @rogerclarkmelbourne, @curtpw, @Gordon, @micooke and in this case @arglurgl

I used code from https://github.com/dingari/ota-dfu-python.git in order to upload firmware with a bluetooth 4.0 dongle on a raspberry pi
code is included in the repository



included is  a  HOWTO on setting up platformio for the smartwatch
included is  a  HOWTO on using scripts to upload firmware 

if you just want to test, you can flash output.hex to your smartwatch

some backgroundinfo can be found here : https://github.com/najnesnaj/smartband

----------------------------------------------------------------------

initially the time is set to the compile time (which would not be correct)

the program acts as a CTS (current time service) client and recovers the current date and time from a central every time the side button is pressed.

You can use "nordic nRFConnect app" to set up a CTS server.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
furthermore, there is a "led service" 
BLEService("19b10010e8f2537e4f6cd104768a1214");

if you write something to that service, it does not switch a led, but puts the watch in DFU mode   (buttonless DFU(device firmware update) mode)

in order to get to buttonless DFU I modified the bootloader

components/libraries/bootloader/dfu
nrf_dfu.c

 
 __WEAK bool nrf_dfu_enter_check(void)
 {
 uint32_t  regwaarde;
 sd_power_gpregret_get(&regwaarde);
 if (regwaarde==0xB1){
         return true;
	 }






once in dfu-mode, you can use the uploadblue script to upload firmware via bluetooth, afterwards the watch goes back to normal bluetooth mode

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
under the "src" directory you'll find the "arduino" program with some "nordic" flavours
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I found a lot of usefull information on https://gitter.im/nRF51822-Arduino-Mbed-smart-watch/Lobby
----------------------------------------------
important Remark!
===============================
the normal state of the watch is sleep-mode, you can wake it up by touching the front touch button
it will remain alive for 15 seconds (only during this time bluetooth will work)

so touch it : and then update it!
